Name: Counter Box
Description: Do you have hatred in your heart? Do you love the suffering of others? This may be the deck for you! Set up a counter targeting your opponent's deck and watch them cope. Milotic ex blocks all damage from Teras like Ogerpon, Dragapult, and Charizard. Farigiraf ex shuts down damage from basic Pokémon ex like Raging Bolt and the entirety of Tera Box. Cornerstone Ogerpon ex shuts down any Pokémon with abilities, like Charizard ex and Gholdengo ex, and has an attack to shred through other walls. Manage your Mist Energies effectively to shut off effects that can cut through your walls, like Roaring Moon ex's Frenzied Gouging or damage counter placement from Dragapult ex, and heal up any leftover damage with Poké Vital A. Have fun with your supervillain arc!
